# AgentMarkdown

An accurate, extensible, and fast HTML-to-markdown converter.

AgentMarkdown is a [HTML user agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) that parses HTML, performs a document layout according to the [CSS stylesheet for HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#the-css-user-agent-style-sheet-and-presentational-hints) and then "renders" the laid out document to Markdown. This results in markdown that looks very similar to the way the HTML document looked when parsed and rendered in a browser (user agent).

# Building

The package is written in TypeScript. To build the package run the following from the root of the repo:

    yarn build # It will be built in /dist

## Release Process (Deploying to NPM) üöÄ

To deploy a **pre-release version** to NPM, tag a commit in master branch with a semver-compatible git tag and **postfixed with** an NPM distribution tag of `beta`. For example:

    git tag 1.0.1-beta

To deploy a **production** version to NPM, tag a commit in master branch with a semver-compatible git tag **WITHOUT** a NPM distribution tag. For example:

    git tag 1.0.1

In this case, since no NPM distribution tag is provided the `latest` tag will be used making it a normal production release.

NOTE: To get the tag to GitHub push it with `git push --tags`.

NOTE: If you want to move the git tag that was already pushed to the remote (GitHub) to a different commit you must delete it on the remote like `git push --delete origin 0.8.7-beta` and then push it with `git push --tags`. Or do the abbreviated from by force-pushing it like `git push --tags -f`.
