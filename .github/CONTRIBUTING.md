# Contributing

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

- Write tests
- Ensure the linter passes with `yarn lint`
- Ensure the tests pass at [the CI Server](https://travis-ci.org/activescott/agentmarkdown) by [following the status](https://help.github.com/articles/about-statuses/) of your pull request.

#### Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also, we use the git commit messages to **generate the change log**.

The commit message formatting can be added using a typical git workflow or through the use of a CLI wizard ([Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)). To use the wizard, run `yarn run commit` in your terminal after staging your changes in git.
